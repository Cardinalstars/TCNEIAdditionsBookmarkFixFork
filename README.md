# TCNEIAdditions
Mod that improves and fixes Thaumcraft NEI Plugin.

ðŸš¨ **Requires [SpongeMixins](https://github.com/GTNewHorizons/SpongeMixins) as a dependency** ðŸš¨

## Features:
* Rewritten Aspect-from-ItemStack Recipe. It is usable now: improved and doesn't cause lag. Can be accessed by pressing R on an aspect in NEI.
* Rewritten Aspect Combination Recipe. Added new gui, divided all old info into Crafting (What aspects does provided contain) and Usage (In what aspects is provided contained) recipes.
* Improved Wand Recipe handling. If some mod adds custom recipes for wands, it will display them (if the research was completed). If ArcaneWandRecipe or ArcaneSceptreRecipe are deleted from ThaumcraftAPI#craftingRecipes, it will remove standard Wand Recipe Handlers and won't show them.
